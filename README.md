# PSW and PUSN projects

Created during 2nd semester on Master degree studies on Warsaw University of technology

No code present in this repository is of fine quality as it was written in a rush, with a lot of duplicates between projects :)

Catu - 3C CNC milling machine simulator
Geru - 3d jelly simulation
Haru - 1D spring
Hodo - Hodograph (Circle with a stick; piston)
Hokan - Quaternion and Euler angles interpolation
Kata - 2-segment arm pathfinding
Keiro - Generating G-Codes for 3C for model designed in CadCat
Nigari - Spinning cube simulation (very painful to write for some unknown reason)
Puma - Inverse Kinematics for PUMA robot
